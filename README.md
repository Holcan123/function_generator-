Hola querido internauta!

My name is ρ.D.ρ (Rhodro) and I wanted to show you what I've been working on these days!

This project is a polynomial generator using numpy! and matplotlib. When you run the main file, a polynomial of degree N is automatically generated and plotted. 
You can interact with it by clicking on a random point on this graph. Six things should appear in the terminal:


1: The number of constants the polynomial has

2: The constants that are

3: The polynomial equation

4: The X,Y coordinates of each point of this polynomial

5: The coordinates of the point you are currently touching

6: The approximation of the root using the Newton-Raphson method

This project took me quite a few days and it's something I've really set my mind to! (mainly because I don't want to think too much about other things either) but the important thing is that I'd rather be racking my brains over this.

I used this project to combine everything I've learned messing around with Python. There are things that are unnecessary, but I'm doing them so I can use what I've learned, and if everything goes as planned, 
the next project will be just as interesting, or not, who knows! Feel free to leave a comment giving feedback on things I can improve, and remember:

""la vida nos zarandea de maneras que no podemos imaginar con situaciones que probablemente te dejen mirando a una pared por un buen rato pero almenos usemos el tiempo en no lamentarnos por lo que ya paso sino en construirnos para lo que viene!!"
